## Task:
Predict the risk of borrowers in 2020 based on various indicators using 2019 data.
## The models:
LogisticRegression<br/>
RandomForestClassifier
## More considerations:
Determine model performance with this data to determine the best model for determining risk. Scale the data and determine effect on model performance. Within the notebook, I have noted my prediction for the best performing model, the results of the models, and the results of the models after scaling the data.
